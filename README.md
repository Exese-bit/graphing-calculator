**Java Graphing Calculator**

An interactive graphing calculator built in Java that combines console-based function input with a fully interactive GUI. This project is designed for advanced mathematical calculations and visualization. 

**Features**

- Console Input: Enter one or multiple explicit functions directly in the console.
- **Custom Math Engine**: Handles advanced operations including:
  - Integrals
  - Derivatives
  - Products
  - Sums
- Custom Function Parser: Parses explicit functions for computation.  
- **Interactive GUI:**
  - Graphing with multiple functions, combined with antialiasing for a smooth look.
  - Pan and zoom to explore the graph in detail.
  - Labeled grid lines to keep track of points/location of the graph.

 **Usage**
 - Run the program with an IDE or from the command line.
 - Enter your function in the console, e.g:
    5+x+sin(tan(x))       This will output the following: <img width="1194" height="1196" alt="20251014_18h43m12s_grim" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35c33a21-6d53-4f83-8cb9-9a99b5199278" />


- Type "graph" into the console to confirm all functions, opening the interactive GUI.
- Use your mouse to move the graph around with left click and pan. 
- Use your mousewheel to zoom in/out, or press i to zoom in and o to zoom out.
- Close the window to end the program.
